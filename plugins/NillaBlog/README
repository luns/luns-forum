Install/Setup:

1.	Move the 'NillaBlog' folder under the 'plugins' directory of your
	vanilla	installation.

2.	Enable the NillaBlog plugin found in the administration dashboard.

3.	Configure the plugin.

NillaBlog works by inserting css class names into various html
elements in order to style them.  The plugin comes with a set of
default styles.

An option can be set to prevent default style injection if you have
built your theme to support the css class names that the plugin uses.

Two class names are currently used in this plugin.  'NillaBlog' and
'NillaBlog#' where # is the Vanilla CategoryID of the blog category.
You may use the latter class name in css when it is desired to style
multiple blogs differently from one another.
